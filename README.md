# puzzle-solve

This is a tiny program that is meant for solving fill-the-board
puzzles with straight-line movement rules.  Given a 5x5 board with
some set of off-limits blocks, it will find a solution that starts at
some block, and fills all the remaining squares in the board by making
moves that go in perpendicular straight lines.  A move must continue
until it reaches the end of the board, or an already filled square.

## Usage

To solve the built-in puzzle:

    lein run

If you want to solve a different puzzle, modify the `puzzle` var in
`puzzle-solve.core`.

If you want to solve a non-5x5 puzzle, then modify the magic numbers ;)
